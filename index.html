    <h6>Emerging Journalism Models and Creative Commons</h6>
    <p>Old models of news delivery are changing, being complimented, and even supplanted by entirely new models.</p>
    <h3>Propublican</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/">Propublica</a> is an independent newsroom that encourages other sites to reproduce their stories. Propublica also gives certain stories first to major news outlets, such as the New York Times and CNN, in order to maximize their impact.</p>
    <h3>Groundreport</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.groundreport.com/">Groundreport</a> covers global news. It has over 5,000 contributors, citizen journalists from all around the world with various levels of experience, who submit articles, photos, and videos of news events, which are vetted by a staff of editors. Groundreport publishes stories on its site and through syndication partners such as Google News, the Huffington Post, and YouTube; and shares 50% of its advertising revenue with its contributors, based on unique traffic to posts.
