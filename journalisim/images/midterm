    <p>Sea creatures are being affected by us littering! 70% of our litter sinks into the sea floor and effects the lower half of the sea level.</p>

  <h2>Picking up after ourselves</h2>
  <p>
    <p>Picking up after ourselves instead of throwing our trash wherever could help save and protect the ocean. The plastic we throw out reaches the ocean and puts the sea creatures in danger. Most sea creatures such as turtles get affected by it because they mistake the plastic bags as their food.</p>
